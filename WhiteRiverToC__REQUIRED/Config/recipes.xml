		This is the code that makes it so a player can take their basic citizen's card and craft the 100z or 1000z quest
		to obtain their higher tiered card. I've moved the ability to gain these upper tiered cards to the trader's quests
		This pevents people from exploiting these quests and running several in parallel.

		I'm leaving this code in place in case someone wants to re-enable this legacy/old-style method of starting these quests.
