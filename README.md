## White River - Tools of Citizenship

This modlet extends the new player White Run citizenship quest line to provide some gather & craft quests to obtain famed tools and equipment. This gives new players a chance to obtain better gear through a method other than randomness. The rewards this Modlet provides was carefully considered against Vanilla gameplay.

The White River Settlements has some extra gear that they've collected. They are using this extra equipment to provide a select few survivors access to higher quality equipment, through volunteering to provide items and materials for training classes being held there. In addition to the reward, the player is also offered a small stack (50-150) of wet concrete blocks, from the last of the Trader's community inventory.
