## 7 Days to Die : White River - Tools of Citizenship

<https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/12269-white-river-tools-of-citizenship-quests-a194-with-df-multiple-languages>

Tested with A20

The White River settlements are looking for new citizens to give extra tools and equipment that they've collected. They are offering to provide a select few survivors access to higher quality equipment in exchange for volunteering to complete various tasks for the settlement. There is a limited supply and these items are only available to those who gain citizenry with White River settlements. In addition to the reward, the player is also offered a small stack of wet concrete blocks, from the last of the Trader's community inventory to assist in re-establishing a homestead.

--

This modlet collection extends the new player White River citizenship quest line to provide some quests to obtain improved tools, weapons, and armor. Each item has a small back-story and explanation in an attempt to blend with the vanilla game and Trader. This gives players a chance to obtain better equipment through a method other than randomness or traditional progression. The rewards this modlet pack provides were carefully considered against Vanilla gameplay. In most cases, the named items only provide a small improvement over the items they were created from. The duke and experience rewards are in-line with vanilla quests, and across all quests and tiers in this modlet pack only a handful of skillpoints are offered and only on the highest complexity quests. Due to the multi-tier design of this modlet collection, it provides equipment for beginners all the way up through the elite.

**This modlet pack is XML XPath ONLY and only needs to be installed on the server or player hosting the game! Other players do not need to install this modlet pack locally.**

The modlet collection provides multi-tier quest lines. Once the new player reaches the trader, they are given a +Declaration of Citizenship item. This allows them to begin a quest to volunteer to help lay to rest 10 old residents now turned zombie. This earns the player a +White River Citizenship Card which they can then use to select which quest they would like to pursue. The player's citizenship card is returned to them after they complete the settlement's quest. If it is lost for any reason, the player may start this quest again as a Tier 1 Trader quest, and also can randomly find a +White River Citizenship Card on zombie loot bags.

### Citizenship is offered in three-tiers:

- Tier 1 : Kill 10 Zombies. This is the Basic level of citizenship. Reward: +White River Citizenship Card
- Tier 3 : Kill 100 Zombies. This is the Veteran level of citizenship. This is started as a Tier 3 Trader quest. Reward: +White River Veteran Citizenship Card
- Tier 5 : Kill 1000 Zombies. This is the Elite level of citizenship. This is started as a Tier 5 Trader quest. Reward: +White River Elite Citizenship Card

Once the player obtains their citizenship card, they can use this to craft quest-starter items for the equipment quests below. Some of the quests below offer a veteran version which rewards better quality, more items, and greater quantity of each multi-quantity item. Some offer an even higher level set of rewards for elite citizens. After a "Veteran" quest is complete, the Trader keeps your Veteran Citizenship Card, requiring you to complete the Tier 3 Trader quest again to obtain a new Veteran Citizenship Card. However, after an "Elite" quest is complete, an Elite Citizenship Card is returned.
