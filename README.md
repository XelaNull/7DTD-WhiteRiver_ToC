## White River - Tools of Citizenship

This modlet collection extends the new player White Run citizenship quest line to provide some gather & craft quests to obtain improved tools and equipment. Each item has a small back story and explanation in an attempt to blend with the Vanilla game and Trader. This gives new players a chance to obtain better gear through a method other than randomness or traditional progression. The rewards this Modlet provides were carefully considered against Vanilla gameplay. In most cases, the named items only provide a slight improvement over the items they were created from.

The modlet provides a multi-tier questline, first requiring the player to craft a +Declaration of Citizenship. This allows them to begin a quest to volunteer to help defend the settlement by killing 10 zombies. This earns the player a +White Run Citizenship Card which they can then use to select which quest they would like to pursue. The player's citizenship card is returned to them after they complete the settlement's quest. If it is lost for any reason, the player can craft a new Declaration of Citizenship to start the process over of becoming a White Run citizen.

The White River Settlements is looking for new citizens and has some extra gear that they've collected. They are offering this extra equipment to provide a select few survivors access to higher quality equipment, through volunteering with the settlement to provide items and materials for training classes being held there. These items are only available to those who gain citizenry with White River settlements through killing zombies in the area. In addition to the reward, the player is also offered a small stack (50-150) of wet concrete blocks, from the last of the Trader's community inventory.

### Citizenship is offered in two-tiers:

- Tier 1 : Kill 10 Zombies. This is the basic level of citizenship.
- Tier 2 : Kill 50 Zombies. This is the Veteran level of citizenship.

Once the player obtains their citizenship card, they can use this to craft quest starter items for the quests below. Tier 2 offer better quality, more items, and greater quantity of each multi-quantity item. However, after each "Veteran" quest is complete, only a basic citizenship card is returned. The player must successfully complete the Tier 2 citizenship quest again in order to pursue another Veteran equipment quest below.
