Tested with 1.0

The White River settlements are looking for new citizens to give extra tools and equipment that they've collected. They are offering to provide a select few survivors access to higher quality equipment in exchange for volunteering to complete various tasks for the settlement. There is a limited supply and these items are only available to those who gain citizenry with White River settlements. In addition to the reward, the player is also offered a small stack of concrete blocks, from the last of the Trader's community inventory to assist in re-establishing a homestead.

--

This modlet collection extends the new player White River citizenship quest line to provide some quests to obtain improved tools, weapons, and armor. Each item has a small back-story and explanation in an attempt to blend with the vanilla game and Trader. This gives players a chance to obtain better equipment through a method other than randomness or traditional progression. The rewards this modlet pack provides were carefully considered against Vanilla gameplay. In most cases, the named items only provide a small improvement over the items they were created from. The duke and experience rewards are in-line with vanilla quests, and across all quests and tiers in this modlet pack only a handful of skillpoints are offered and only on the highest complexity quests. Due to the multi-tier design of this modlet collection, it provides equipment for beginners all the way up through the elite.

**This modlet pack is XML XPath ONLY and only needs to be installed on the server or player hosting the game! Other players do not need to install this modlet pack locally.**

The modlet collection provides multi-tier quest lines. Once the new player reaches the trader, they are given a +Declaration of Citizenship item. This allows them to start working through proving their worth as a possible citizen, through performing quests for White River. This earns the player a +White River Citizenship Card which opens up another tier of quests to complete. The player's citizenship card is returned to them after they complete the settlement's quest. If it is lost for any reason, the player may start again through another Declaration of Citizenship.

### Citizenship is offered in four-tiers:

- Tier 1 : Declaration of Citizenship - These quests are to prove your worth as a citizen. Reward: +White River Citizenship Card
- Tier 2 : White River Citizen - These are the standard/normal tier quests. Reward: +White River Veteran Citizen Card
- Tier 3 : White River Veteran - These are the veteran tier quests. Reward: +White River Elite Citizen Card
- Tier 4 : White River Elite - These are the elite tier quests.

The player uses their citizenship card (or declaration card) to craft quest-starter items for the equipment quests below. Some of the quests below offer progressive tier such as veteran version which rewards better quality, more items, and greater quantity of each multi-quantity item. Some offer an even higher level set of rewards for elite citizens.

### Challenges Support

With v1.0 also comes native support for the game's challenges page to track your progress through your White River citizenry. With this, we have changed the way that you progress through the citizenship tiers. Instead of tying the citizenship tiers merely to killing zombies, we have now tied the progression to this achievements page and configured it so that you must complete each tier of quests in order to progress to the next tier. This closes a previous loop and provides for a slightly slower progress, at the expense of players now will no longer be able to just complete whatever quests they want and ignore others.

### Questable Equipment:

**VEHICLES**
- **Amelia's Gyrocopter** - Discover the truth of what happened to Amelia Earhart. Fight a Wendigo to reclaim her long-lost schematics explaining how to build a three-seater souped-up Gyrocopter. Guaranteed to get you and your friends across the map with speed and ease.
- **Spirit of Vengeance** - Take on a demon Juggernaut and obtain a super-fast vehicle. A player using this vehicle is a sure-sign of their elite status. Big thanks to **Snufkin's Server-Side Zombies** & **Snufkins's Server-Side Vehicles** for a big part of the base code for the vehicle and zombie. Tested for compatibility with Snufkin's mods, so you can run both at the same time if you want!

**TOOLS:**
